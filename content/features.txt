## Slide 4: Deep Dive: AI Assistant & UEBA

* **AI Assistant (GenAI):**
    * [cite_start]Splunk & Elastic (5/5, 4/5) are the clear leaders with powerful, native AI assistants. 
    * [cite_start]Wazuh (2/5) has no native GenAI and relies on community projects. 
* **UEBA:**
    * [cite_start]Splunk & Elastic (5/5, 4/5) offer mature, ML-driven UEBA. 
    * [cite_start]Wazuh (2/5) relies on basic anomaly detection, lacking true user-centric analysis.

## Slide 5: Deep Dive: Third-Party Integration & Flexibility

* **Third-Party Integration:**
    * [cite_start]All platforms (5/5) are excellent, with vast ecosystems, marketplaces, and community support for connecting with other tools. 
* **Flexibility & Customization:**
    * [cite_start]Wazuh (5/5) offers maximum freedom as a fully open-source solution. 
    * [cite_start]Elastic (4/5) is highly flexible but has some proprietary commercial features. 
    * [cite_start]Splunk (3/5) is less flexible due to its proprietary nature.

## Slide 6: Deep Dive: Operations & Implementation

* **Ease of Implementation:**
    * [cite_start]Splunk (4/5) is easiest to start with due to mature SaaS and professional services. 
    * Elastic (3.5/5) offers flexible deployment (SaaS/on-prem), but can require considerable configuration effort.
    * [cite_start]Wazuh (3/5) is the most complex, requiring significant time and manpower. 
* **Ease of Operation:**
    * [cite_start]Elastic (4/5) has the most analyst-friendly, modern UI. 
    * [cite_start]Splunk (3.5/5) has a steep learning curve but is efficient once mastered. 
    * [cite_start]Wazuh (3/5) demands higher technical skills for daily operations.

## Slide 7: Key Findings Summary

* **Wazuh:**
    * [cite_start]**Pros:** Ultimate flexibility and the lowest TCO. 
    * [cite_start]**Trade-offs:** Implementation and daily operations require significant in-house technical resources [cite: 33, 37, 40][cite_start]; lacks native advanced features (AI/UEBA). 
* **Elastic:**
    * [cite_start]**Pros:** A good balance between modern features, ease of use, and predictable cost [cite: 42][cite_start]; has the most analyst-friendly, modern UI. 
    * [cite_start]**Trade-offs:** While flexible, some features are proprietary; [cite_start]TCO is higher than Wazuh. 
* **Splunk:**
    * [cite_start]**Pros:** Possesses the market's top-tier, most mature features (AI/UEBA) [cite: 44][cite_start]; easiest to get started with due to mature SaaS and professional services. 
    * [cite_start]**Trade-offs:** Less flexible due to its proprietary nature [cite: 29][cite_start]; significantly the highest TCO.
