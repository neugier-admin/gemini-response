Of course, here is the English translation of the comparison.

---

### **Elastic (ELK Stack)**

* **Native Features:**
    * Integrates native SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) capabilities and includes a built-in Threat Intelligence management platform.
    * Utilizes its proprietary advanced search language, `$ES|QL$` (Elasticsearch Query Language), designed specifically for time-series data and security analytics.

* **Machine Learning / UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics):**
    * This is one of its major strengths. The platform offers over 50 pre-built machine learning jobs focused on User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) to effectively detect anomalous activities.

* **3rd-Party Integration:**
    * Supports over 400 out-of-the-box integration solutions, with an ecosystem covering a wide range of data sources and tools.

* **AI-Driven Features:**
    * Features AI-driven Attack Discovery.
    * Provides an AI Assistant to help analysts with queries and investigations.

* **Flexibility & Licensing:**
    * Its core components are open-source, but many advanced features (like SOAR, advanced ML models) are under a proprietary commercial license, offered through a tiered subscription model.

### **Splunk**

* **Native Features:**
    * Includes a powerful built-in Splunk SOAR platform and provides a Tuning Framework for detection rules, Alert Suppression, and Throttling capabilities.
    * Uses its extremely powerful proprietary Search Processing Language ($SPL$), which is recognized as an industry standard.

* **Machine Learning / UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics):**
    * Widely recognized as a market leader in threat detection and UEBA, offering a mature and feature-rich Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) and applications.

* **3rd-Party Integration:**
    * Boasts a very mature and extensive ecosystem (Splunkbase). Through its powerful data processing capabilities, it supports integration with the vast majority of third-party applications and data sources.

* **AI-Driven Features:**
    * Offers the Splunk AI Assistant, designed to simplify search queries, assist with debugging, and automate script generation.

* **Flexibility & Extensibility:**
    * The platform provides a comprehensive set of RESTful `$APIs$` and Webhooks, facilitating deep custom development and the integration of automated workflows.

### **Wazuh**

Wazuh is an open-source security platform, often positioned as an XDR (Extended Detection and Response) and SIEM solution. Its positioning is slightly different from ELK and Splunk, with a stronger focus on endpoint-level protection and monitoring.

* **Native Features:**
    * **Core focus is on endpoint security:** Based on a Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS), it collects logs and events via agents installed on endpoints (servers, computers).
    * **Core functionalities include:** File Integrity Monitoring, Security Configuration Assessment, Vulnerability Detection, and Active Response.

* **Machine Learning / UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics):**
    * **Lacks native capabilities:** Wazuh itself does not include a built-in advanced machine learning or UEBA engine.
    * **Relies on integration:** Its analytical capabilities primarily depend on integration with a back-end platform, most commonly the **Elastic Stack**. Users can leverage Elastic's machine learning features to analyze data collected by Wazuh.

* **3rd-Party Integration:**
    * **Deep integration with the Elastic Stack:** Wazuh's official architecture uses it as a data collection and analysis front-end, paired with Elasticsearch for storage and indexing, and Kibana (Wazuh Dashboard) for visualization, forming a complete SIEM solution.
    * It also supports integration with external tools like VirusTotal, PagerDuty, and Slack to enhance threat intelligence and alerting capabilities.

* **AI-Driven Features:**
    * Similar to its machine learning capabilities, Wazuh does not offer a native AI Assistant or other AI-driven analytical features. Any AI functionality would come from its integrated back-end platform (e.g., the Elastic AI Assistant).

* **Flexibility & Licensing:**
    * **Completely open-source:** This is Wazuh's biggest feature. The entire platform is **100% free and open-source**, with no software licensing fees.
    * **Highly customizable:** Being open-source allows users to freely modify and extend its functionality, offering extreme flexibility.
    * **Maintenance overhead:** While there are no license fees, it requires a significant investment in human resources for deployment, configuration, maintenance, and tuning.

### **Summary Comparison**

| Feature | Elastic (ELK) | Splunk | Wazuh |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Positioning** | Big Data Analytics Platform, SIEM | Enterprise SIEM, Data Analytics Leader | Open-Source HIDS, XDR/SIEM Solution |
| **Key Strengths** | Powerful ML/UEBA models, Search performance | Mature ecosystem, Powerful $SPL$ language | **Completely Open-Source**, Endpoint security focus |
| **Search Language** | $ES|QL$ | $SPL$ | Relies on back-end (usually Elasticsearch) |
| **ML / AI** | Native support (mostly paid features) | Native support (market leader) | Lacks native support; requires integration (e.g., with Elastic) |
| **Cost Model** | Open-Source + Commercial Subscription | Commercial License (data volume or compute-based) | **Completely Free** (requires self-maintenance) |
| **Best Suited For** | Teams with strong technical skills seeking a high price-performance ratio. | Enterprises needing a mature, comprehensive, and well-supported solution. | Organizations with a limited budget but strong in-house technical expertise. |
