### **3. Maintenance & Administration**

| Criteria | Elastic SIEM (Enterprise) | Splunk Enterprise Security | RZY | Wazuh |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ease of Implementation** | **3.5 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** On-premise cluster deployment is complex and requires a deep understanding of Elasticsearch architecture, especially planning for data nodes and master nodes. | **3.5 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** Splunk's distributed deployment (indexer cluster, search head cluster) is equally complex, requiring professional training or experienced engineers. | **4.0 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** In theory, the vendor handles most of the deployment, making it simpler for the in-house team. However, this requires diligent management of the vendor's project schedule and quality. | **4.0 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** A single-node deployment is simple. However, building a resilient, high-availability cluster (Wazuh cluster + Elastic cluster) increases complexity exponentially. |
| **System Administration** | **3.5 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** Daily administration tasks like Index Lifecycle Management (ILM), snapshot/restore, and performance tuning require specialized knowledge. | **4.0 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** Provides more GUI-based management tools (e.g., Monitoring Console), making it less reliant on the command line compared to Elastic. The management experience is more mature. | **3.5 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** Unknown. It could be a "black box," with routine maintenance highly dependent on the vendor. Slow vendor response could become a bottleneck. | **3.5 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** Requires managing two systems: the Wazuh Manager and the Elastic Stack. Operations like upgrades and scaling must be carefully planned to ensure compatibility. |
| **Data Onboarding** | **4.5 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** Extremely flexible. From Filebeat and Logstash to Ingest Pipelines, it offers multi-layered data processing capabilities to handle any log format. | **4.5 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** The Universal Forwarder + Heavy Forwarder combination is a golden standard. While the syntax of props.conf / transforms.conf is dated, it is very powerful. Splunkbase has many TAs (Technical Add-ons) for parsing. | **3.5 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** Relies on parsers or agents provided by the vendor. For non-standard log sources, one must wait for vendor development, leading to uncertain timelines and costs. **[Custom]** | **4.0 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** The Wazuh Agent collects endpoint logs. Other sources like network devices or cloud logs need to be collected with Logstash or custom scripts and sent to Elastic. Requires significant DIY work. **[Custom]** |
| **Learning Cost** | **3.5 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** Requires learning KQL (Kibana Query Language), EQL (Event Query Language), and Elasticsearch's underlying concepts. The learning curve is moderate to high. | **3.0 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** SPL (Search Processing Language) is extremely powerful but has a steep learning curve. Proficiency requires significant practice and experience, making it a specialized skill. | **4.5 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** If the vendor handles everything, the learning cost for the in-house team could be the lowest. However, this is also a risk, as the team loses control and understanding of the system. | **3.0 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** The highest learning cost. Requires proficiency in Linux, Wazuh, Elasticsearch, Kibana, and potentially Logstash/Fluentd. This is a full-stack requirement. |
| **(Suggested) \<br\>Scalability** | **4.5 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** Horizontal scaling is a core advantage of Elasticsearch. Ingest and query performance can be scaled linearly by adding more data nodes. | **4.5 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** Splunk's indexer clustering also provides very strong horizontal scalability, proven in large enterprises handling petabytes of data daily. | **3.0 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** Scalability is completely unknown and requires the vendor to provide success stories and architectural proof. It may be limited to vertical scaling, which is costly and has a ceiling. | **4.0 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** Like Elastic, the underlying Elastic Stack is highly scalable. However, this requires manual planning and management to ensure the Wazuh manager does not become a bottleneck. |

| **Infra Cost (HW/SW)** | **3.5 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** Elasticsearch requires significant RAM and fast SSDs for optimal performance. The initial hardware investment is not cheap. | **3.0 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** Hardware requirements are equally high, if not higher. A significant hardware investment is necessary to meet ingest and search performance demands. | **3.5 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** Hardware specifications are recommended by the vendor with low transparency. This may lead to over-provisioning. | **4.0 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** While the software is free, the hardware costs are on par with Elastic/Splunk and cannot be avoided. |
| **Project Cost** | **3.5 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** The license fee is based on a resource-based (vCPU/RAM) pricing model, which is transparent and more predictable than Splunk. Implementation service (man-hour) costs are significant. | **3.0 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** The main cost is the license, calculated by daily data ingest volume (GB/day). It is very expensive, and data growth can lead to budget overruns. | **4.0 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** May be offered as a fixed-price project, making initial costs clear. However, one must be wary of hidden clauses in the contract, such as how new log sources are charged. | **5.0 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** No license fees. However, the implementation service/man-hour costs will be the highest, as everything must be built from scratch. Outsourcing this work would also be costly. |
| **OpEx (Annual Cost)** | **4.0 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** The annual subscription fee includes support. The cost is advantageous compared to Splunk and does not penalize for sudden spikes in data volume. | **3.0 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** The annual license fee is extremely high and constitutes the largest expenditure. Support fees are typically included. | **3.5 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** The annual maintenance fee includes support services. It is crucial to clarify if upgrades and new features incur additional charges. | **4.5 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** Without commercial support, OpEx consists only of hardware maintenance and personnel costs. If purchasing support from Wazuh Inc. or a third party, it is still cheaper than Splunk/Elastic. |
| **Cost Saving** | **4.0 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** ILM can be used to move old data to "cold" storage (commodity HDDs), significantly reducing storage costs. A single platform for Logs, APM, and Metrics offers consolidation benefits. | **3.5 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** Splunk also has data tiering capabilities. The biggest cost saving comes from improved SOC efficiency, but this is difficult to quantify. | **3.0 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** Potential cost saving lies in reducing the workload of the internal team. However, if vendor service is poor, it could increase communication and time costs instead. | **5.0 / 5.0**\<br\>**Comment:** The biggest cost saving is the absence of license fees. For companies willing to invest in human resources, the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) can be the lowest. |

### **Conclusion & Recommendation**

These four solutions represent four different philosophies and trade-offs. There is no absolute "best" solution, only the one that is most suitable for your company's current situation and future goals.

1.  **For Performance, Flexibility, and In-House Technical Strength â Elastic SIEM**

      * If your team is capable and willing to master the technology, Elastic offers nearly limitless possibilities with a more controllable Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) compared to Splunk. Its powerful search and machine learning capabilities are aligned with the future trends of security analytics.

2.  **For Stability, Maturity, and Out-of-the-Box Functionality (with sufficient budget) â Splunk Enterprise Security**

      * If budget is not the primary constraint and the goal is to rapidly deploy a feature-complete, mature, and widely-adopted solution, Splunk remains the safest bet. SOC analysts can become productive quickly, and the vast amount of pre-built content delivers immediate value.

3.  **For a Strong Emphasis on Localized Service and Outsourcing â RZY**

      * This is the highest-risk option, as it creates a high dependency on a single vendor. **A very thorough Proof of Concept (PoC) is strongly recommended.** This should not only validate the claimed features but also test the vendor's responsiveness, problem-solving skills, and the quality of their custom work. All service items and pricing models must be clearly defined in the contract.

4.  **For Extremely Limited Budgets and a Strong DIY Technical Team â Wazuh**

      * If the company culture embraces open-source and has the confidence and resources to "build" rather than "buy" a platform, the Wazuh + Elastic Stack combination is a highly cost-effective choice. It forces the team to learn every detail of the SIEM, which can build a very strong internal security team in the long run.

* **Machine Learning / UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics):**
    * This is one of its major strengths. The platform offers over 50 pre-built machine learning jobs focused on User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) to effectively detect anomalous activities.

---

### **Wazuh**

Wazuh is an open-source security platform, often positioned as an XDR (Extended Detection and Response) and SIEM solution. Its positioning is slightly different from ELK and Splunk, with a stronger focus on endpoint-level protection and monitoring.

* **Native Features:**
    * **Core focus is on endpoint security:** Based on a Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS), it collects logs and events via agents installed on endpoints (servers, computers).
    * **Core functionalities include:** File Integrity Monitoring, Security Configuration Assessment, Vulnerability Detection, and Active Response.

* **Machine Learning / UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics):**
    * **Lacks native capabilities:** Wazuh itself does not include a built-in advanced machine learning or UEBA engine.
    * **Relies on integration:** Its analytical capabilities primarily depend on integration with a back-end platform, most commonly the **Elastic Stack**. Users can leverage Elastic's machine learning features to analyze data collected by Wazuh.

* **3rd-Party Integration:**
    * **Deep integration with the Elastic Stack:** Wazuh's official architecture uses it as a data collection and analysis front-end, paired with Elasticsearch for storage and indexing, and Kibana (Wazuh Dashboard) for visualization, forming a complete SIEM solution.
    * It also supports integration with external tools like VirusTotal, PagerDuty, and Slack to enhance threat intelligence and alerting capabilities.

* **AI-Driven Features:**
    * Similar to its machine learning capabilities, Wazuh does not offer a native AI Assistant or other AI-driven analytical features. Any AI functionality would come from its integrated back-end platform (e.g., the Elastic AI Assistant).

* **Flexibility & Licensing:**
    * **Completely open-source:** This is Wazuh's biggest feature. The entire platform is **100% free and open-source**, with no software licensing fees.
    * **Highly customizable:** Being open-source allows users to freely modify and extend its functionality, offering extreme flexibility.
    * **Maintenance overhead:** While there are no license fees, it requires a significant investment in human resources for deployment, configuration, maintenance, and tuning.
