**Dear [Recipient Name/IT Department],**

I hope this email finds you well.

We are preparing for a Proof of Concept (POC) to test the Wazuh security platform. To proceed, we require a testing environment with three virtual machines.

Could you please assist us by setting up the following VMs with the specifications listed below?

**Overall Requirements:**

**VM 1: Wazuh Server**
* **Purpose:** To host the Wazuh Manager, Indexer, and Dashboard.
* **OS:** Linux (We will provide an OVA file for this installation).
* **Hardware:**
    * **CPU:** 8 Cores
    * **RAM:** 16 GB
    * **Storage:** 100 GB

**VM 2: Linux Test Server**
* **Purpose:** To test the Wazuh agent and rsyslog forwarding.
* **OS:** Please use the primary Linux OS version that is standard in your environment.
* **Hardware:**
    * **CPU:** 2 Cores
    * **RAM:** 4 GB
    * **Storage:** 50 GB

**VM 3: Windows Test Server**

* **Hardware:**
    * **CPU:** 2 Cores
    * **RAM:** 4 GB
    * **Storage:** 50 GB

Once the VMs are provisioned, please let us know so we can provide the OVA file for the main Wazuh server and begin our testing.

Thank you for your support. Please let me know if you have any questions.
